# Csense kotlin assistance 
This plugin is made to help with programming in kotlin and to avoid common JVM issues, and other weird cases, where the compiler nor the IDE (IDEA) warns about potential issues.
Examples include
 - wrong initialization order
 - mismatching parameter / lambda names
 - problems with inheritance and initialization order
